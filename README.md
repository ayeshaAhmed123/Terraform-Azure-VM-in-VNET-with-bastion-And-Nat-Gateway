# VNet-VM-NAT Terraform Project

## Overview

This project provides a robust, modular Infrastructure as Code (IaC) solution using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to provision and manage a virtual network (VNet), virtual machines (VMs), and NAT (Network Address Translation) resources in a cloud environment. The architecture is designed for scalability, maintainability, and security, making it suitable for both development and production workloads.

### Module Breakdown

- **compute_module**: Handles the provisioning and management of virtual machines and related compute resources.
- **network_module**: Manages virtual networks, subnets, NAT gateways, and related networking components.
- **security_module**: Configures security groups, firewall rules, and other security-related resources.

## Benefits of a Modular Terraform Structure

Adopting a modular structure in Terraform projects offers several key advantages:

- **Reusability**: Modules can be reused across different environments (dev, staging, prod) or even across different projects, reducing duplication and effort.
- **Maintainability**: Isolating resources into modules makes it easier to update, test, and maintain specific parts of the infrastructure without affecting others.
- **Collaboration**: Teams can work on different modules concurrently, improving development velocity and reducing merge conflicts.
- **Scalability**: Modularization allows for easier scaling of infrastructure components, as modules can be instantiated multiple times with different configurations.
- **Consistency**: Using modules enforces best practices and consistent resource definitions across the organization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) (v1.0 or higher)
- Cloud provider credentials (e.g., Azure)
- Properly configured backend for state management (optional but recommended)

## Configuration

- Edit `terraform.tfvars` to provide values for required variables (this file is gitignored for security).
- Review and adjust variables in `variables.tf` as needed for your environment.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/vnet-vm-nat.git
   cd vnet-vm-nat


2. **Initialize Terraform:**
  ```sh
terraform init
3. **Plan and apply:**
  ```sh
terraform plan
terraform apply

4. **Destroy resources (when needed):**
  ```sh
terraform destroy
